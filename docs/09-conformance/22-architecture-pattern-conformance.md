# Architecture Pattern Conformance

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the mandatory conformance scenarios for the seven architecture patterns.

## 2. Circuit breaker scenarios

A conforming implementation proves that repeated qualifying failures open the breaker, open calls fail fast without reaching the destination, one bounded half-open probe is admitted, successful recovery closes the breaker, failed recovery reopens it, local independent capabilities remain available, and manual override produces authorization and receipt evidence.

## 3. Dead-letter scenarios

A conforming implementation proves transient retry with jitter, immediate quarantine for a known permanent failure, quarantine after maximum attempts, preservation of message identity and digest, tenant isolation, alert generation, denied unauthorized redrive, successful authorized redrive after compatibility repair, and receipted discard.

## 4. Distributed workflow scenarios

A conforming implementation proves idempotent step replay, pending visibility, timeout handling, reverse compensation for reversible completed steps, forward repair for an irreversible completed step, no cross-owner database lock, no hidden partial success, restart recovery from persisted state, and terminal receipt completeness.

## 5. Large payload reference scenarios

A conforming implementation proves inline-limit enforcement, owner-controlled storage, bounded locator, digest verification, audience and capability checks, expiry enforcement, retention through workflow terminal state, safe retry, and orphan cleanup without premature deletion.

## 6. Experience view adapter scenarios

A conforming implementation proves that the adapter aggregates only declared interfaces, each owner rechecks authorization, direct database writes are impossible, business rules remain in owners, fan-out is bounded, dependency failure produces explicit partial state, and removing the adapter does not remove owner capabilities.

## 7. CQRS projection scenarios

A conforming implementation proves command rejection at the projection, idempotent source consumption, checkpoint recovery, bounded lag, read-your-write behavior where declared, full rebuild, deletion propagation, fresh authorization bypassing the projection, and no owner-state mutation during rebuild.

## 8. Cache-aside scenarios

A conforming implementation proves safe empty-cache operation, cache miss loading from the owner, write-before-invalidation, TTL enforcement, tenant separation, negative-cache expiry, stampede protection, cache-unavailable behavior, labeled stale reads within bounds, and prohibition of stale authorization.

## 9. Cross-pattern scenarios

UCKK publication and import tests must combine workflow, resilience, dead-letter, and large-payload behavior. kOA Spaces tests must combine view-adapter, projection, cache, and resilience behavior without changing authorization or business ownership.

## 10. Release gate

A release claiming any activated pattern must provide:

- the validated artifact instance;
- schema-validation evidence;
- applicable test results;
- operational dashboard and alert identifiers;
- failure-injection evidence;
- recovery or rebuild evidence;
- receipts for governed transitions;
- a profile compatibility statement.

Absence of this evidence blocks the pattern conformance claim and any dependent release claim.

## Product UI portability checks

Conformance for a product-facing interface includes these structural checks where the product declares both standalone and integrated modes:

- the standalone entry point remains product-owned and does not require kOA Spaces or another optional product;
- integrated routes, navigation, commands, inspectors, and widgets are contributed through declared public interface contracts;
- the integrated product registry is derived from installed and admitted manifests, not a hard-coded mandatory product list;
- surface profiles reuse product-owned routes and capabilities instead of duplicating pages;
- removal of one optional product does not require source changes to unrelated products;
- menu or surface visibility never substitutes for owner-side authorization.
