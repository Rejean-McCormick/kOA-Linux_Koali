# Development Profile Conformance

## 1. Purpose

This document defines conformance evaluation for the two kOA development primary profiles:

`text
developer_linux_workstation
developer_windows_wsl
`

Development-profile conformance proves that a workstation can host reproducible, isolated, concurrently runnable development workspaces without confusing mutable development state with release artifacts or production authority.

The evaluation has three related subjects:

`text
developer workstation profile
 → workspace contract
 → executed workspace evidence
`

The workstation claim proves that the selected primary profile and its host boundary are correctly implemented.

The workspace claim proves that one workspace has a stable identity, isolated dependencies, namespaced services and state, bounded resources, reproducible inputs, and an independent lifecycle.

The parallel-execution evidence proves that multiple branches or applications can operate simultaneously without collisions or implicit mutable sharing.

A passing development-profile claim does not prove:

- release conformance;
- production readiness;
- sovereign-node conformance;
- high-assurance conformance;
- offline production conformance;
- component business correctness beyond the tests executed;
- publication or artifact activation.

The model preserves these distinctions:

`text
development convenience
is not architectural authority

shared download cache
is not shared installed state

container readiness
is not application authorization

local success
is not release evidence
`

## 2. Scope

This document applies to claims for:

- `developer_linux_workstation`;
- `developer_windows_wsl`;
- individual developer workspaces;
- branch checkouts;
- Git worktrees;
- task workspaces;
- Python dependency environments;
- service containers or equivalent workspace namespaces;
- local databases;
- local queues;
- workspace networks;
- host-port allocations;
- local sockets;
- local certificates;
- secret references;
- temporary and log state;
- resource budgets;
- concurrent workspace execution;
- clean-environment rebuild;
- build and test execution;
- transition from development to immutable artifacts.

It governs:

- claim scope;
- profile distinction;
- workspace identity;
- contract validation;
- UV and Python environment rules;
- mutable-state isolation;
- database and secret isolation;
- ports, networks, and sockets;
- resource governance;
- reproducibility;
- lifecycle and teardown;
- Windows WSL boundary evidence;
- parallel-execution testing;
- evidence;
- result calculation;
- reevaluation.

It does not mandate one container engine, Linux distribution, Windows edition, WSL distribution, init system, desktop environment, database engine, editor, integrated development environment, or shell.

Those choices remain owned by active profile contracts, component contracts, toolchain contracts, or non-normative recipes.

## 3. Canonical References

## 4. Model and Responsibilities

### 4.1 Claim hierarchy

The claim hierarchy is:

`text
development_profile_claim
 → host_boundary_claim
 → workspace_contract_claim
 → workspace_runtime_claim
 → parallel_execution_claim
 → reproducibility_claim
 → teardown_claim
`

A profile claim can include several workspace claims. Every mandatory subordinate claim must pass before the profile claim passes.

### 4.2 Profile distinction

The profiles remain distinct:

| Profile | Host boundary |
| --- | --- |
| `developer_linux_workstation` | Native Linux development workstation |
| `developer_windows_wsl` | Windows host with an explicitly identified WSL Linux environment |

The profiles can share workspace semantics without sharing every implementation check.

Native-Linux evidence and WSL evidence remain separately attributable.

### 4.3 Claim scope

A profile claim records:

`text
claim_id
profile_id
profile_contract_version
host operating-system identity
Linux environment identity
architecture
hardware envelope
container or namespace implementation
filesystem roots
network exposure model
included workspace_ids
evaluator
validator versions
test refs
evidence refs
exceptions
result
validity
`

A workspace claim records the exact source revision and workspace contract version.

### 4.4 Workspace identity

A workspace identity derives from:

`text
component + branch_or_purpose + unique_suffix
`

Examples:

`text
konnaxion-main-a31f
konnaxion-feature-voting-92cd
orgo-main-b114
`

The `workspace_id` prefixes or namespaces mutable collision domains.

The display name can change. The stable identity and namespace relationship remain testable.

### 4.5 Source-control context

The workspace declares:

- repository identity;
- workspace kind;
- ref name;
- optional commit identity;
- repository-relative root;
- clean-state requirement for validation.

A branch, worktree, or task workspace remains development state rather than a release artifact.

### 4.6 Dependency environment

Every workspace owns one mutable dependency environment.

For Python, the canonical model is:

`text
UV
pyproject.toml
uv.lock
.python-version
.venv
uv sync --frozen
`

A content-addressed UV download cache can be shared. Installed packages and the mutable `.venv` cannot.

Lockfile refresh is an explicit development action rather than a validation side effect.

### 4.7 Service and state isolation

Mutable services use workspace-prefixed identities.

Namespaced state includes at least:

`text
dependency_environment
containers
networks
volumes
database_names
database_users
database_schemas
unix_sockets
temporary_directories
log_directories
pid_files
service_names
secret_names
local_certificates
development_queues
host_ports
`

The implementation can use rootless containers, workspace namespaces, or a profile-approved equivalent.

The isolation claim concerns behavior, not product branding.

### 4.8 Database isolation

Every workspace uses workspace-scoped database identities.

Permitted profile-owned models can include:

- separate database;
- separate schema;
- separate instance;
- a declared combination.

Mutable database sharing across workspaces is not part of the passing baseline.

Component data ownership remains active inside development. One component does not write directly to another component's authoritative source records.

### 4.9 Secret isolation

Workspace contracts contain secret references rather than values.

Secret evidence verifies:

- workspace namespace;
- reference resolution;
- source or provider identity;
- non-reuse across workspaces unless an explicit safe shared credential class exists;
- generated local-certificate namespace;
- cleanup or revocation at teardown;
- absence from ordinary logs and reports.

Production credentials are not a development conformance prerequisite.

### 4.10 Ports, networks, and sockets

The endpoint model separates:

`text
workspace-internal endpoints
host-exposed endpoints
workspace-local interprocess communication
`

Fixed internal ports are compatible with isolated networks.

Host ports are allocated through a workspace-scoped allocation registry.

Workspace networks are isolated and prefixed. Cross-workspace connectivity is off by default.

Socket and runtime paths are workspace-scoped and recoverable after stale-state detection.

### 4.11 Parallel execution

The minimum behavioral proof runs at least two workspaces concurrently.

The pair can represent:

- two branches of one component;
- two applications;
- one main workspace and one migration workspace;
- one ordinary workspace and one test workspace.

The test exercises the actual collision domains rather than checking names statically only.

### 4.12 Resource governance

Every workspace declares bounded:

- CPU;
- memory;
- process count;
- I/O priority;
- pending queue depth;
- heavy-job concurrency.

Heavy services such as search engines, workbenches, model runtimes, SenTient, or intensive kOA Mediatheque processing and UCKK package-validation or transport jobs are task-activated where included.

Resource Governor admission remains separate from business and governance authority.

### 4.13 Reproducibility

Reproducibility evidence includes:

- exact runtime versions;
- versioned manifests;
- versioned lockfiles;
- frozen synchronization;
- clean rebuild;
- validation commands;
- dependency-upgrade impact;
- exact source revision;
- validator and tool versions.

A shared cache can accelerate the rebuild without becoming an installed environment.

### 4.14 Windows WSL boundary

The WSL claim records both sides of the boundary.

The Windows-host evidence can include:

- host identity and supported version class;
- selected WSL environment;
- host-to-guest integration;
- host-port exposure;
- filesystem boundary;
- lifecycle start and stop behavior;
- time, DNS, and name-resolution behavior;
- credential and secret boundary;
- editor or tool integration used by the claim.

The Linux-environment evidence executes the ordinary workspace contract inside the selected WSL environment.

A result cannot hide which side supplied a service, filesystem, port, credential, or process.

### 4.15 Workspace lifecycle

Workspace lifecycle states can include:

`text
declared
validated
active
suspended
teardown_pending
retired
failed
`

Creation, activation, teardown, and removal are explicit.

Removing one workspace cannot alter another workspace. Shared content-addressed download caches can remain.

Orphan cleanup covers ports, containers, networks, volumes, sockets, processes, temporary files, logs, database identities, and local credentials.

### 4.16 Development-to-release boundary

Development output becomes a release candidate through:

`text
clean source revision
 → declared build
 → tests
 → provenance
 → immutable artifact
 → publication
 → Release Set evaluation
`

The mutable workspace does not cross this boundary as an artifact.

## 6. Procedures or State Transitions

### 6.1 Profile-claim preparation

Preparation:

1. identify the primary profile;
2. resolve the active profile contract and inheritance;
3. identify host, Linux environment, architecture, and hardware;
4. identify the implementation choices used by the claim;
5. identify included workspaces;
6. load applicable requirements and locks;
7. resolve validators, tests, evidence, and exceptions;
8. block the claim when profile identity or ownership is unresolved.

### 6.2 Host-boundary validation

For native Linux:

1. identify the Linux host and architecture;
2. validate profile capabilities and hardware envelope;
3. validate service, storage, network, and resource implementations;
4. record implementation-specific evidence without making it global.

For WSL:

1. identify the Windows host;
2. identify the selected WSL environment;
3. map host and Linux responsibilities;
4. test filesystem, process, network, port, secret, time, and lifecycle boundaries;
5. record which side produced each result.

### 6.3 Workspace-contract validation

The evaluator:

1. validates the workspace object against the developer-workspace schema;
2. verifies required decisions, requirements, and locks;
3. verifies workspace-id derivation;
4. verifies source-control context;
5. verifies dependency, service, state, database, secret, port, network, parallel, resource, reproducibility, lifecycle, and validation sections;
6. runs semantic reference checks;

### 6.4 Dependency-environment validation

For a Python workspace:

1. verify `pyproject.toml`;
2. verify `uv.lock`;
3. verify `.python-version`;

4. verifies denial;
5. verifies secret references and namespace;
6. verifies absence of values from contracts and ordinary logs;
7. verifies generated local-certificate identity;
8. records cleanup behavior.

### 6.8 Resource test

The evaluator:

1. loads the workspace budget;
2. validates limits and queue bounds;
3. starts ordinary workloads;
4. task-activates included heavy services;
5. applies bounded pressure;
6. verifies admission, throttling, queueing, or denial behavior;
7. verifies that another workspace remains protected;
8. records Resource Governor evidence.

### 6.9 Reproducibility test

Reproducibility testing:

1. records exact source revision;
2. verifies a clean repository;
3. rebuilds the dependency environment;
4. rebuilds generated development outputs required by the test;
5. executes declared validation commands;
6. repeats in another clean environment where required;
7. compares mandatory results;
8. records all tool versions and inputs.

### 6.10 Teardown test

Teardown:

1. stop workspace workloads;
2. release host ports;
3. remove workspace networks and sockets;
4. remove containers or namespace state;
5. remove temporary databases and identities according to the contract;
6. revoke or remove local secrets and certificates;
7. remove temporary and log state according to retention;
8. clean orphaned processes and identifiers;
9. retain only approved shared cache material;
10. verify another workspace remains unaffected.

### 6.11 Result calculation

The evaluator:

1. collects profile, host-boundary, workspace, parallel, reproducibility, resource, and teardown results;
2. verifies evidence scope and freshness;

### 6.12 Reevaluation

Reevaluation occurs after material changes to:

- profile contract;
- WSL or Linux environment;
- architecture;
- workspace schema;
- dependency manager;
- runtime version;
- lockfile;
- container or namespace implementation;
- port allocator;
- network behavior;
- database model;
- resource policy;
- validator;
- test;
- evidence;
- exception.

Affected claims receive linked successors rather than silent extension.

A failed workspace remains isolated from other valid workspaces. A failed heavy service does not invalidate unrelated lightweight workspace capabilities. A blocked release transition does not prevent ordinary local development.

## 8. Cross-Component Interactions

### 8.1 Profile owners

Profile owners define native-Linux and WSL applicability, host boundaries, capabilities, hardware, and conditional implementation rules.

The evaluator does not merge the two profiles.

### 8.2 Workspace tooling

Workspace tooling derives identities, validates contracts, creates namespaces, allocates resources, and performs cleanup.

It does not become the owner of component business data.

### 8.3 UV and language toolchains

UV owns the Python dependency workflow defined by the active toolchain contract.

Other language toolchains can use their own declared isolated environments without weakening the workspace-isolation model.

### 8.4 Resource Governor

Resource Governor enforces CPU, memory, I/O, process, queue, and heavy-job bounds.

It does not authorize component actions or governed disclosures.

### 8.5 Identity and secrets systems

Development identity and secret providers issue workspace-scoped references and local credentials.

They remain separate from production authority.

### 8.6 Database services

Database services provide workspace-scoped identities and component-owned logical stores.

A shared physical server can support several workspaces only while identities and mutable state remain isolated.

### 8.7 Port allocator and network runtime

The port allocator owns host-port reservations.

The network runtime implements isolated logical networks and explicit bounded links.

Neither endpoint reachability nor port ownership grants component authority.

### 8.8 Component owners

Components define development service behavior, schemas, migrations, tests, and data ownership.

Workspace isolation does not permit direct cross-component source writes.

### 8.9 Build and lifecycle systems

Build systems consume clean source and declared environments to produce immutable outputs.

Lifecycle systems verify, publish, activate, roll back, and repair artifacts. They do not activate `.venv` or workspace containers as release artifacts.

### 8.10 Evidence and conformance systems

Test runners and validators produce exact-scope evidence.

Audit and evidence systems store results with selective disclosure and without embedded secrets.

## 9. Decision Closure and Prohibited Assumptions

This document closes development-profile conformance as follows:

- native Linux and Windows WSL are distinct primary profiles;
- every workspace has a stable derived identity;
- every mutable dependency environment is workspace-local;
- every Python workspace uses UV and one `.venv`;
- a shared content-addressed cache is permitted but is not an installed environment;
- services, state, databases, secrets, ports, networks, and sockets are namespaced;
- two branches or applications run concurrently without collisions;
- fixed internal ports are allowed inside isolated networks;
- host ports use a workspace-scoped allocation registry;
- cross-workspace connectivity is off by default;
- database identities are workspace-scoped;
- direct cross-component writes remain prohibited;
- production authority is not a development prerequisite;
- resource limits are explicit;
- heavy services are task-activated;
- clean rebuild and frozen validation are evidenced;
- teardown is independent;
- WSL host and Linux boundaries remain explicit;
- development outputs cross into release only as immutable artifacts.

The following assumptions are prohibited:

- one `.venv` can be shared by several workspaces;
- an activated global Python environment proves workspace conformance;
- a shared cache is a shared environment;
- unique branch names prevent all collisions;
- fixed internal ports imply host-port collisions;
- WSL is identical to native Linux for every check;
- Windows-host services can be attributed to Linux silently;
- a container name alone proves isolation;
- a shared database administrator identity proves database separation;
- production credentials improve development conformance;
- resource availability authorizes a component action;
- rootless containers are mandatory for every platform;
- Podman, Docker, systemd, or another implementation is globally required;
- a successful local test proves release conformance;
- a running development container is an immutable artifact;
- cleanup of one workspace can remove shared mutable state from another;
- ordinary Markdown hashes determine development conformance.

A new global workspace identity rule, dependency-sharing rule, profile-merging rule, or mutable-state promotion path requires an accepted owner decision and complete impact validation.

## 11. Non-Normative Examples

### 11.1 Native Linux parallel branches

Two Konnaxion workspaces use separate `.venv` directories, networks, databases, users, volumes, secrets, sockets, logs, and allocated host ports. Both run concurrently. Removing the feature workspace leaves the main workspace operational.

### 11.2 Windows WSL profile

A Windows host runs one declared WSL environment. Source, `.venv`, sockets, databases, and service state live inside the declared Linux workspace boundary. Host-exposed ports use the allocation registry. The report identifies which host integration and network mode were tested.

### 11.3 Shared UV cache

Two Python workspaces use the same content-addressed UV download cache. Each creates its own `.venv` from its own `uv.lock`. Deleting one `.venv` does not change the other workspace or the cache.

### 11.4 Failed isolation claim

Two branches use different container names but the same database user and schema. The static naming check passes, but the behavioral isolation test fails. The parallel-workspace claim fails.

### 11.5 Development-to-release transition

A clean workspace builds an immutable service package, produces provenance and test evidence, and publishes the package to the services channel. The workspace `.venv`, branch checkout, local database, and running development container remain outside the artifact and release claim.

## Product UI portability checks

Conformance for a product-facing interface includes these structural checks where the product declares both standalone and integrated modes:

- the standalone entry point remains product-owned and does not require kOA Spaces or another optional product;
- integrated routes, navigation, commands, inspectors, and widgets are contributed through declared public interface contracts;
- the integrated product registry is derived from installed and admitted manifests, not a hard-coded mandatory product list;
- surface profiles reuse product-owned routes and capabilities instead of duplicating pages;
- removal of one optional product does not require source changes to unrelated products;
- menu or surface visibility never substitutes for owner-side authorization.
