# Path Ownership and Change Rules

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the rules that keep the frozen file architecture usable as implementation grows. It distinguishes an architectural change from an ordinary addition inside an admitted owner root.

## 2. Ownership Matrix

| Path | Owner | Prohibited content |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `docs/` | Documentation governance | Product source, secrets, mutable state, package payloads |
| `components/<component-id>/` | Named internal component | Another component's domain logic or migrations |
| `host/` | Host platform integration | Business workflow, application state, subsystem internals |
| `integrations/<subsystem-id>/` | kOA integration boundary | Vendored subsystem implementation or direct database mutation |
| `interfaces/` | Transport and binding maintainers | Domain-authority redefinitions |
| `assembly/` | System assembly | Component business rules or hand-maintained profile forks |
| `profiles/` | Profile implementation settings | Canonical profile definitions or copied source trees |
| `packaging/` | Packaging | Release-channel authority, signing secrets, business logic |
| `release/` | Release engineering | Mutable component state or private signing keys |
| `operations/` | Operations implementation | Canonical architecture or hidden business policy |
| `tests/` | Cross-system conformance | Production implementation used only to make tests pass |
| `tools/` | Repository tooling | Product runtime authority |
| `dev/` | Local development | Production secrets or authoritative deployment manifests |
| `ci/` | Reusable CI orchestration | Logic that cannot run locally |
| `generated/` | Generators | Manually maintained source authority |

## 3. Allowed Ordinary Additions

A new source or test file is an ordinary implementation change when all of these conditions hold:

1. it is inside an admitted leaf source, adapter, test, fixture, migration, or packaging directory;
2. its owner is already declared by `path-ownership.json`;
3. it does not introduce a new cross-component dependency;
4. it does not move authority, persistent state, privilege, or release responsibility;
5. it is registered by the owning `component.toml`, `integration.toml`, package metadata, or test manifest where applicable;
6. it passes architecture, dependency, source-pin, generated-content, runtime-path, and conformance checks.

Examples include adding a new use-case module under one component's `application/`, a new adapter behind an existing port, a new migration owned by that component, or an additional test within an existing suite.

## 4. Changes Requiring Architecture Revision

An accepted major architecture decision is required before:

- adding or renaming a top-level directory;
- moving a component between internal and external ownership;
- placing subsystem implementation code inside `koa-linux`;
- creating a shared writable database root;
- introducing a new privileged executable or broker operation class;
- adding a new immutable, configuration, persistent, recovery, or secret root outside the installed filesystem layout;
- making a generated directory manually authoritative;
- creating a profile-specific source implementation tree;
- granting kOA Spaces business, policy, resource, release, identity, or host authority;
- changing a canonical path that is referenced by release, recovery, backup, or conformance evidence.

## 5. Dependency Direction

```text
docs/contracts
      ↓ generation
generated bindings
      ↓
component domain and application
      ↓ through ports
component adapters and integration adapters
      ↓
host and assembly
      ↓
packaging and release
```

The following are prohibited:

```text
component private source → another component private source
component domain         → host, profile, package, or integration implementation
integration A            → integration B private source
kOA Spaces               → privileged broker
presentation manifest    → executable code loading
profile settings         → copied component implementation
release workflow         → undeclared live-state mutation
```

## 6. Naming Rules

- directories and non-language configuration files use `kebab-case` unless an external standard requires another name;
- Python packages use `snake_case` and remain under `src/`;
- Rust modules use `snake_case` and binaries use stable `kebab-case` executable names;
- identifiers in contracts remain stable even when public labels change;
- files named `common`, `shared`, `helpers`, `misc`, or `utils` at a broad root are prohibited unless their exact narrow responsibility is documented;
- generated files include generator and source-state metadata where the format permits it.

## 7. File Size and Splitting

A file SHALL represent one coherent responsibility. Review is mandatory when a source file exceeds 500 logical lines or a normative architecture file exceeds approximately 800 lines. A larger file is permitted only when splitting would obscure a generated table, schema, protocol, or atomic state machine. Otherwise it SHALL be split into responsibility-specific modules or a numbered documentation series.

This architecture itself is split into a series to avoid one oversized inventory file.

## 8. Prohibited Repository Content

The source repository SHALL NOT contain:

- `.git/` data inside release archives;
- private keys, production credentials, access tokens, personal secrets, or decrypted recovery material;
- runtime databases, media blobs, audit stores, backups, receipts, caches, or support bundles;
- copied Konnaxion, Orgo, Ariane, kOA Spaces, SemantiK Architect, SenTient, or UCKK repositories;
- unverified binary dependencies without source, digest, license, and provenance records;
- package manager caches, virtual environments, build directories, container layers, or generated release payloads outside declared generated paths;
- symbolic links that escape the owning repository or installed runtime root.

## 9. Validation Contract

`tools/src/koa_tools/checks/file_architecture.py` SHALL compare committed paths with the generated machine-readable lock derived from this series. The check SHALL fail on unknown top-level roots, ownerless structural files, prohibited generated content, subsystem vendoring, invalid runtime paths, private cross-component imports, or kOA Spaces authority expansion.

A successful documentation validation confirms the consistency of this series. Implementation conformance additionally requires the code-repository checks defined here once the corresponding source scaffold exists.

## Koali product UI modularity

This document is interpreted with the Koali product-interface portability rule:

- each independently packaged product owns its user interface and remains independently operable when its declared standalone mode is supported;
- shared Koali shell and design-system code is reusable presentation infrastructure, not a mandatory product runtime and not a source of business authority;
- an integrated composition host discovers installed and admitted product manifests dynamically rather than hard-coding a mandatory product list;
- a surface profile is a projection of the same product routes, capabilities, commands, and contextual views, not a separately implemented frontend;
- removing one product removes only that product's admitted presentation contributions and SHALL NOT require source changes to unrelated products;
- ordinary shell behavior SHALL NOT require private UI imports from another product; cross-product journeys use explicit public routes, commands, capabilities, or integration contracts.
