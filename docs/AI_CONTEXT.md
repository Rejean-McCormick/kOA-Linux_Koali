# AI Context

This is the single entry point for AI-assisted work.

1. Identify the requested profile and subsystem.
2. Load `contracts/ai-navigation.contract.json`.
3. Load the applicable source contract.
4. For an integrated subsystem, load its documentation from `subsystems/<name>/` when mounted.
5. Load the kOA boundary page.
6. Use generated indexes only for discovery.
7. When the task concerns UCKK or learning content, classify the direction explicitly as `publish_to_uckk` or `import_from_uckk`; load the matching integration, package, receipt, bridge, and kOA Mediatheque contracts. Never infer a generic synchronization path.
8. When the task concerns navigation, module selection, sidebar entries, top-bar widgets, public module aliases, or Space activation, load `contracts/subsystems/koa-spaces.subsystem.json`, the two kOA Spaces system documents, the applicable Space definition, and every referenced module interface manifest. Treat all presentation artifacts as non-authoritative.
9. When the task concerns security architecture, profile hardening, security conformance, release security gates, control exceptions, or security evidence, load `contracts/security-controls.contract.json`, `07-security/21-security-control-architecture.md`, `07-security/22-security-control-profile-matrix.md`, `contracts/artifact-contracts/security-evidence.schema.json`, and every thematic security document referenced by the applicable control. Treat the contract as the owner of control identity and applicability; treat thematic documents as the owners of control meaning and behavior.

10. Validate before activation.

11. When the task concerns remote resilience, asynchronous failure, a multi-owner transition, large media in messages, experience aggregation, a read projection, or a cache, load `contracts/architecture-patterns.contract.json`, `02-system/34-architecture-patterns.md`, and the applicable artifact schema. Treat adapters, projections, and caches as non-authoritative; require terminal evidence for workflows and dead-letter closure.

## Product UI portability context

When reasoning about Koali interfaces, preserve product autonomy: a product UI can be standalone and can also contribute to an optional integrated host. Do not assume kOA Spaces owns product pages or is required for standalone operation. Treat surface profiles as projections of one product implementation, and treat removal of one product as independent from unrelated product interfaces.
