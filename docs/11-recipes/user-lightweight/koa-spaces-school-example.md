# Example: Isolated School Space

## Purpose

This non-normative example shows how one Space can present a school-oriented interface while preserving stable subsystem and component identities.

## Module Selector

```text
Home
Learn
Library
Assignments
Guidance
Administration
```

Possible stable identities behind those labels:

| Public label | Stable interface module ID | Owning system or capability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Home | `space_home` | kOA Spaces |
| Learn | `uckk_learning` | UCKK learning import and online access surfaces |
| Library | `koa_mediatheque` | kOA Mediatheque |
| Assignments | `orgo_schoolwork` | Orgo contribution |
| Guidance | `ariane` | Ariane contribution |
| Administration | `koa_administration` | Declared kOA administrative surfaces |

The public labels can change without renaming contracts or authority domains.

## Learn Sidebar

When offline, **Available offline** and other local routes remain available. Online discovery and download actions enter a declared unavailable state.

## Top Bar

Global items:

Learn module widgets:

```

## Local-First Behavior

The school can operate for an extended period without Internet access. Imported courses, manuals, media, and locally stored progress remain under their respective local authorities. Reconnection does not upload progress or adaptations automatically.

## Administrative Separation

A teacher or learner Space can omit the Administration module even when the installation provides it. This omission is presentation policy only. Administrative authorization remains enforced by the owning service.

## Modular product-interface behavior

This recipe assumes product UI portability. A product that supports standalone operation keeps its own product-owned entry point. When an integrated composition host is selected, the product contributes the same admitted routes and capabilities through its interface manifest. Reduced surfaces are projections of that product definition rather than separate frontends. Removing the product removes its integrated contributions without changing unrelated product source code.
