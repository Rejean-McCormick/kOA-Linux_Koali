# Konnaxion integration boundary

This directory contains only the kOA-owned integration boundary for the independently owned Konnaxion subsystem. It does not contain Konnaxion application code, database migrations, internal APIs, workflows, state machines, validation rules, or authoritative documentation.

## Current activation state

Activation is disabled. The authoritative corpus defines the required documentation mount at `subsystems/konnaxion/`, but that mount is not present and no repository URL, immutable revision, source digest, or license declaration is supplied. `source.lock.json` records this absence explicitly and requires fail-closed admission.

The files in this bundle therefore establish a preparation boundary, not final alignment with Konnaxion internals.

## Ownership

Konnaxion owns its domain model, workflow, state, complete API, internal user interface, and subsystem-specific validation. kOA owns only deployment membership, lifecycle, resources, identity and trust boundaries, network and storage exposure, artifact admission, declared cross-subsystem interactions, health integration, backup coordination, and safe degradation.

The adapter must never write directly to Konnaxion storage or another subsystem's authoritative state. Presentation visibility does not grant authorization.

## Interface contribution

The interface manifests expose only one local capability: `konnaxion.integration_status`. The `/konnaxion` route is a presentation-only adapter status surface. It does not claim or reproduce any Konnaxion business feature.

## Activation prerequisites

All of the following are required before activation:

1. mount the official documentation at `subsystems/konnaxion/`;
2. record the authoritative repository and immutable revision;
3. verify source digest and license metadata;
4. validate compatibility with the pinned subsystem and kOA contracts;
5. provide the common transport, health, receipt, job, identity, and capability interfaces;
6. resolve profile-specific network, storage, backup, and resource policies;
7. pass adapter boundary, health, degradation, removal, and authority tests.

No repository presence, installed package, environment variable, reachable endpoint, or provider account may activate the integration implicitly.

## Files

- `source.lock.json`: source admission state and immutable contract pin;
- `compatibility.json`: exact contract and interface-schema compatibility;
- `integration.toml`: integration identity, ownership, capability and security boundary;
- `deployment.toml`: process, transport, network and profile declaration;
- `resource-envelope.toml`: fail-closed resource resolution requirements;
- `health.toml`: health and readiness semantics;
- `storage.toml`: storage ownership and separation;
- `backup.toml`: coordinated backup and restore boundary;
- `degradation.toml`: explicit failure and removal behavior;
- `interface/`: presentation-only module, sidebar and status widget manifests;
- `adapter/pyproject.toml`: packaging metadata for the future kOA-owned adapter.

## Product UI portability

Konnaxion owns its standalone interface runtime, internal navigation, and product surfaces. The Koali integration contributes only admitted presentation metadata. kOA Spaces is an optional composition host, not a Konnaxion runtime dependency. Integrated navigation is derived from the Konnaxion manifest, and removing the Konnaxion integration removes only Konnaxion contributions from the integrated registry without requiring source changes to other products.
